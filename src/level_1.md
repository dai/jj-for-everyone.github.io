# Level 1

This level will provide you with the bare minimum of skills you need to get work done.
It's only enough for the simplest use cases and you're working alone.
For example, students who track and submit their homework with a Git repository won't need more than this. 

The following "cheat sheet" contains the most important commands from level 1.
Use it to prime your brain before getting started and remind yourself later when you forget something.
