## Contributing

I'm happy to receive small fixes like typos as pull requests.
For larger content suggestions, please [open an issue](https://github.com/jj-for-everyone/jj-for-everyone.github.io/issues/new).
I am also very interested in experience reports, for example:
- Do you have any frustrations with Jujutsu which the tutorial did not help you overcome?
- Was there a section that wasn't explained clearly?
  (If you didn't understand something, it's probably the tutorial's fault, not yours!)
- Did you complete a level but didn't feel like you had the skills that were promised in the level overview?
- Is there something missing that's not being taught but should?
- Do you feel like the content could be structured better?

Thank you for helping me improve this tutorial!
